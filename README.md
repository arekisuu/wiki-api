# wiki-api
### 📰 API for managing Wiki article(s).

### My very first API, built using REST principles. 

#### ✨ Minified ver. now available for best performance! 🚀
The original code (app.js) is full of comments so that you're be able to understand how everything works and make your own changes.
So feel free to do just that and I sincerely hope that this small piece of contribution serve you well. Happy coding! 👩🏻‍💻
